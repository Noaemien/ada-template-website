# The Scouting Report: Three Pillars of Victory

To determine the 'Power Rankings' of our competitors, we analyze three key metrics. These aren't just pages; they are athletes, and this is their stat sheet:

## 1. Efficiency

Does this page accelerate the game or kill the momentum? We measure whether visiting a page helps players reach their target faster or acts as a 'trap' where paths go to die.

## 2. Popularity

The Crowd Favorite. How often does this page appear in successful, completed paths? A hub is only useful if players actually find it and use it.

## 3. Versatility

The All-Rounder. How many different topics does it connect? A true champion connects Science to History, and Geography to Pop Culture without breaking a sweat.

We will combine these components to calculate the comprehensive 'Hub Score' for every article.
