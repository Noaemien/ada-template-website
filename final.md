# The Grand Final

After weeks of competition, countless matchups, and relentless eliminations, the World Cup of Hubs reaches its final moment.

Two hubs remain.

Both have survived the group stage, the repechage or direct qualification, and three knockout rounds. Each followed a different path, faced different opponents, and proved its strength under pressure.

## The Final Match

The Grand Final is decided in a single, decisive confrontation.

This is the last match.  
There are no second chances.
