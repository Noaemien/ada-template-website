# The Grand Final

After weeks of competition, countless matchups, and relentless eliminations, the World Cup of Hubs reaches its final moment.

Two hubs remain:  
[United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) vs [United Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom)

Both have survived the group stage and three knockout rounds. Each followed a different path, faced different opponents, and proved its strength under pressure.

On their way to the final, the **United States** had to overcome a mix of artist and strong national challengers, including **Paul McCartney**, **Germany**, and **South Africa**.

The **United Kingdom**, on the other hand, eliminated a combination of scientific conceptand countries, knocking out the **Periodic Table**, **Israel**, and **Japan**.

Before revealing the outcome, we invite you to pause for a moment. Open the two pages, scroll through them, and trust your intuition. Which one *feels* more central, more connected, more influential? Sometimes, the winner can already be guessed by simply looking at the hubs themselves.

## The Final Match, And the Champion Is…

The Grand Final is decided in a single, decisive confrontation.

The two hubs are evaluated head-to-head using the same scoring framework as in previous rounds. All metrics are applied consistently, and only relative performance matters.

Let's reveal the results metric by metric. 

**Efficiency** is something we saw the UK struggle with in it's match against Japan. How does it fair against the USA here.

![Match analysis](images/UK_vs_USA_eff.png)

As you can see it's a very, **very** close match. Both seem to be on equal standings regarding how quickly they lead to victory in the Wikispedia games.

Now let's look at **Versatility**. The UK was much more versatile than Japan before, it is going to manage to win this metric over the USA?

![Match analysis](images/UK_vs_USA_ver.png)

Once again a terribly close call but the USA maanges to pull ahead here! So far this match has proven to be extremely close! But one hub must make it out on top. Will popularity clear up the winner? We saw how much more popualr the UK was before with Japan. This could be a chance for the UK to secure the victory! Let's look at this final metric :

![Match analysis](images/UK_vs_USA_pop.png)

USA complelty slams the door on the UK with popularity. It proves it is the dominent Hub by winning over the UK (which was already a very promising hub) in all three metrics. USA has it all, it helps reach the end goal faster, it has a wide breadth of connections and it is immensely popular. Here is the final score :

## Looking Back at the Tournament : Which betting strategy was the best ?

Now the part you have been waiting for : Did you win some money ?

We always assume players have 80 $ and bet 10 $ on each of 8 articles.

---

#### Strategy 1 – Follow the bookmakers

![Graph of the wikipedia network based on beetweenness centrality measure](images/graph_wikipedia.png)

If someone simply follows the odds given by the bookmakers on the real competition, they would win on:

| Article        | Odd  | Result |
|----------------|------|--------|
| United States  | 1.00 | WIN    |
| United Kingdom | 3.36 | WIN    |
| Europe         | 4.34 |        |
| England        | 5.09 |        |
| France         | 5.23 |        |
| Germany        | 5.75 | WIN    |
| World War II   | 6.07 |        |
| Africa         | 6.99 |        |

Total return:

- `10 × (1.00 + 3.36 + 5.75) = 10 × 10.1 = 101.1 $`

Profit:

- `101.1 $ − 80 $ = 21.1 $`

---

#### Strategy 2 – Perfectly predict the Top 8 hubs

If someone predicted the 8 best hubs (including one article not even offered by the bookmakers):
 
  **United States, Russia, South Africa, United Kingdom, Israel, China, Germany, Adolf Hitler**

The return from the 7 bettable winners would be:

- `10 × (1.00 + 8.05 + 10.63 + 3.36 + 11.53 + 8.35 + 5.75) = 486.7 $`

Profit:

- `486.7 $ − 80 $ = 406.7 $`

Note to mention that Adolf Hitler was not even proposed by the bookmakers, showing that the bookmakers could'nt predict the competition well and that the graph analysis alone is not sufficient enough to estimate wikispeedia's players behaviors.
Underdogs that were not proposed to bet on is part of the game (that's one way how bookmakers can make money)

---

#### Strategy 3 – Use global popularity

Picking the top 8 most popular pages on Wikipedia over the last 10 years.  
We realize that these are **not** the same as the nodes favored by the Wikipedia link architecture, so the overlap with the bookmaker’s list is limited : Indeed, we need to go up to the 15th most visited page of Wikipedia to find 8 articles that are also porposed by the bookmakers.

| Rank | Top article by popularity on the real world wikipedia | Selected in strategy | Result |
|------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|--------|
| 1    | United States                                         | X                    | WIN (1.00) |
| 2    | Wikipedia                                             |                      |        |
| 3    | India                                                 | X                    |        |
| 4    | Google                                                |                      |        |
| 5    | World War II                                          | X                    |        |
| 6    | Adolf Hitler                                          |                      |        |
| 7    | United Kingdom                                        | X                    | WIN (3.36) |
| 8    | Barack Obama                                          |                      |        |
| 9    | World War I                                           | X                    |        |
| 10   | Michael Jordan                                        |                      |        |
| 11   | Winston Churchill                                     |                      |        |
| 12   | China                                                 | X                    | WIN (8.35) |
| 13   | Elvis Presley                                         |                      |        |
| 14   | Canada                                                | X                    |        |
| 15   | Australia                                             | X                    |        |


Total return:

- `10 × (1.00 + 3.36 + 8.35) = 127.10 $`

Profit:

- `127.10 $ − 80 $ = 47.1 $`

This strategy outperforms the one directly following the bookmakers’ odds. It shows that using **page popularity** can be more reliable for predicting players’ behavior than relying only on the **graph architecture**.

Since the Wikispeedia game database is built from **all** players, it would be interesting to organize a second “World Cup of Hubs” but this time based only on the **best players**. In that setting, we might expect the bookmakers’ graph-based strategy to perform better, because top players are more likely to choose **efficient links** rather than links that simply sound familiar.

#### Strategy 4 : Human Intuition

Let's see how much money our group made...

| Player | Winning bets                         | Profit                                       |
|--------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Noa    | -                                    | - 80\$ + 0\$ = - 80\$                        |
| Tolga  | United_States, China, United_Kingdom| -80\$ + 1* 10\$ + 8.35* 10\$ + 3.36* 10\$ = 47.10\$ |
| Antoine| -                                    | - 80\$ + 0\$ = - 80\$                        |
| Max    | United_States                        | -80\$ + 1* 10\$ = -70\$                      |
| Julien | United_States, China                 | -80\$ + 1* 10\$ + 8.35* 10\$ = 13.5\$        |

this shows that based on no serious strategy, humans perform pretty badly on this type of gamble. Did you do better ? Lets see :

#### Strategy 5 : YOUR BET

Below you can see the 8 contenders you selected on the betting floor and how they compare to the actual final Top 8.

<div id="yourBetSummary"></div>

<script>
(function () {
  const winners = [
    "United_States",
    "United_Kingdom",
    "South_Africa",
    "Germany",
    "Israel",
    "Adolf_Hitler",
    "Russia",
    "China"
  ];

  const summaryEl = document.getElementById("yourBetSummary");
  if (!summaryEl) return;

  let stored = null;
  try {
    stored = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("wc_hubs_bet") || "null");
  } catch (e) {
    stored = null;
  }

  if (!Array.isArray(stored) || stored.length !== 8) {
    summaryEl.innerHTML = "<p><em>No saved bet found. Go back to the betting floor, place your 8 bets, then return here.</em></p>";
    return;
  }

  const winningPicks = stored.filter(p => winners.includes(p.name));
  const sumOdds = winningPicks.reduce((sum, p) => {
    const odd = typeof p.odd === "number" ? p.odd : parseFloat(p.odd);
    return sum + (isNaN(odd) ? 0 : odd);
  }, 0);

  const stake = 80;
  const betPerArticle = 10;
  const totalReturn = betPerArticle * sumOdds;
  const profit = totalReturn - stake;

  const listItems = stored.map(p => {
    const isWinner = winners.includes(p.name);
    const label = p.name.replace(/_/g, " ");
    return `<li>${label} : ${p.odd.toFixed(2)} ${isWinner ? " &rarr; WIN (is in final Top 8)" : ""}</li>`;
  }).join("");

  summaryEl.innerHTML = `
    <p>Your 8 selected hubs:</p>
    <ul>${listItems}</ul>
    <p>Number of your hubs that reached the final Top 8: <strong>${winningPicks.length}</strong></p>
    <p>Sum of the odds of your hubs that are in the final Top 8: <strong>${sumOdds.toFixed(2)}</strong></p>
    <p>Since you bet ${betPerArticle}$ on each hub (total stake ${stake}$), your total return would be <strong>${totalReturn.toFixed(2)}</strong> and your profit <strong>${profit.toFixed(2)}</strong>.</p>
  `;
})();
</script>
