## The Repechage : Second Chance Round

Finishing outside first place does not mean elimination.

Hubs ranked **2nd, 3rd, and 4th** in their respective groups enter the **Repechage** 

By the end of the repechage, the remaining contenders will go through to go into the **Round of 16**.

## Who Qualifies for the Knockout Phase

By the end of the group stage and the repechage, the field is reduced to **16 hubs**:

- **8 Group Winners**, who finished first in their respective groups  
- **8 Repechage Winners**, who earned their place through the second-chance round  

These 16 competitors advance to the **Round of 16**, marking the beginning of the knockout phase.

## Building the Knockout Bracket

The knockout stage is not drawn at random.

To reward strong performance in the group stage and preserve competitive balance, the bracket is built using a **seeding system**, similar to those used in tennis Grand Slams.

The rules are as follows:

- Each **group winner** is paired against a **repechage winner** in the Round of 16  
- Group winners are assigned a **seed** based on their pre-tournament odds of winning

This ensures that the winner of the group stage face gets a litttle advantage by normally facing a weaker opponent from the *loser bracket*. In other words, the better a hub performs early on, the more favorable its path becomes but nothing is guaranteed.

It is still a deadly match, we might see some upsets !

The bracket is constructed so that:
- the **top seed** and the **second seed** can only meet in the **Grand Final**,  
- other high seeds are placed on opposite sides of the bracket,  
- and potential matchups become progressively harder as the tournament advances.

It is time ot discover the final table of the tournament !
