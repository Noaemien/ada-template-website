# Welcome to the World Cup of Hubs!

Everyone knows Wikipedia, the world's encyclopedia. But do you have the skills to conquer Wikispeedia?

In the arena of Wikispeedia, the goal is simple: travel from a random Start Page to a specific Target Page exclusively by clicking internal links. It's a race against time and clicks. For years, players have navigated this labyrinth, but a burning question remains: Which pages are the true champions of navigation?

No human knows every path. But the data does.

## The Tournament Begins

We are proud to announce the inaugural WORLD CUP OF HUBS. We are turning the Wikipedia network into a battlefield. By mining the massive dataset of thousands of historical Wikispeedia games, we aren't just looking for popular pages; we are hunting for the 'Playmakers': the articles that act as the ultimate shortcuts, the strategic pivots, and the winning hubs.

We have analyzed player behavior and the intrinsic graph structure of the network to determine which pages are the undisputed heavyweights of the internet.
