# Welcome to the World Cup of Hubs!

Everyone knows Wikipedia, the world's encyclopedia. But do you have the skills to conquer Wikispeedia?

In the arena of Wikispeedia, the goal is simple: travel from a random Start Page to a specific Target Page exclusively by clicking internal links. It's a race against time and clicks. For years, players have navigated this labyrinth, but a burning question remains: Which pages are the true champions of navigation?

No human knows every path. But the data does.

## The Tournament Begins

We are proud to announce the inaugural WORLD CUP OF HUBS. We are turning the Wikipedia network into a battlefield. By mining the massive dataset of thousands of historical Wikispeedia games, we aren't just looking for popular pages; we are hunting for the 'Playmakers': the articles that act as the ultimate shortcuts, the strategic pivots, and the winning hubs.

We have analyzed player behavior and the intrinsic graph structure of the network to determine which pages are the undisputed heavyweights of the internet.

## How the World Cup Works

We turn Wikipedia navigation into a football-style tournament.

From thousands of articles appearing in Wikispeedia games, only the strongest hubs qualify. These contenders then compete through different stages:

- **Qualifiers** to select the competitors  
- A **group stage**, where hubs face diverse opponents  
- A **knockout phase**, with no second chances  
- A **final**, crowning the ultimate navigation champion  

To decide who advances, each hub is evaluated using three main metrics :

- **Efficiency** : does visiting this page help players reach their target faster, or does it slow them down?  
- **Versatility** : how many different topics and destinations does this page connect?  
- **Popularity** : how often is this page actually used in successful navigation paths?  

We aggregate them to then have a final scoree. Hubs will be compared locally at each stage of the tournament to keep fair matchups and especially to keep the suspense, it would be too easy to reveal the winner already !

For now, the game is on. Let's go meet our competitors !
