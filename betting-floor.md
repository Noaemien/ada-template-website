# The Betting Floor

What is a World Cup without high stakes?

Before the first match is played, predictions are already circulating.  
Since the outcome of the tournament is uncertain, and the Wikispeedia navigation data is not publicly accessible, bets must be placed under imperfect information.

On the betting floor, one group sets the odds.  
Another decides whether to trust them.

## The Bookmakers : Setting the Odds

The bookmakers are responsible for publishing the official odds of winning.

To do so, they rely on **publicly available Wikipedia Pageview data**.  
Their logic is straightforward: pages that are visited frequently in the real world are more likely to be encountered and used during navigation.

Using pageview statistics, bookmakers assign **pre-tournament odds** to each competing hub.

However, popularity is not the whole story.

Behind the scenes, bookmakers are aware that other structural properties of Wikipedia may influence navigation success. These additional signals are deliberately kept hidden at this stage of the competition.

## The Odds Board

The table below shows the odds assigned to each competitor before the tournament begins.

These odds reflect **expectations**, not outcomes.

## Surprising Favorites and Risky Outsiders

Some odds are immediately intuitive.  
Well-known pages are expected to perform well.

Others are more surprising.

A few globally famous pages receive lower odds than expected, while less obvious hubs quietly emerge as strong contenders.

## The Team Choices

Before the tournament begins, we also place our bets.

Each member of the project team has chosen a personal **“horse”** to follow throughout the World Cup of Hubs. 



As the tournament goes on, we will track how our picks perform and see whether human intuition can keep up with the data.

Let's see what motivated all our choices :

## Pick your contender !

Now you step onto the betting floor.

As a **gambler**, you only have access to public information:  
what you know, what your intuition suggest you, and what the odds suggest.

Will you trust global fame?  
Or will you go for a promising outsider and go against the bookmakers ?  

Choose a hub you believe will go far in the tournament !
