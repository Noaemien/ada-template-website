# The Betting Floor: Bookmakers vs. Gamblers

What is a World Cup without high stakes? Since the outcome is uncertain and nobody (apart from organizers) have access to Wikispedia game data, two distinct prediction strategies have emerged. Both of them want to earn the most money but who will be able to understand the gamer behaviors the best? It is a battle of Human Intuition vs. Hard Math.

## The Gamblers (The 'Crowd Wisdom' Strategy)

These are the humans. They rely on instinct and familiarity. Their logic is simple: 'If I know this page, I'm more likely to click it.' Motivated by intuition, they use public Wikipedia Pageview data to guide their bets. They believe that global fame equals navigation success.

• The Strategy: High global visibility = High odds of winning.

## The Bookmakers (The 'Data Science' Strategy)

These are the heavy hitters with the budget to burn. They don't care about fame; they care about structure. Having aced their Data Analysis courses at EPFL, the Bookmakers treat Wikipedia as a mathematical object. They have extracted the underlying skeleton of the site to analyze it as a graph.

• The Strategy: They use Betweenness Centrality to scientifically isolate the 64 best hubs. They don't guess; they calculate.

Below are the results of the Bookmakers' analysis—the mathematically predicted Top 64:
