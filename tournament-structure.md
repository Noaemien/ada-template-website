# The Tournament Structure

The road to the trophy is long and perilous. Here is how the 6,000 articles will be whittled down to one champion:

- The Qualifiers: From a pool of 6,000 articles, only the Top 64 will survive the initial data cut.
- The Group Stage: 8 Groups of 8 Articles.
- The #1 ranked page in each group qualifies directly for the Round of 16.
- The Repechage (The Second Chance): The pages ranked 2nd, 3rd, and 4th in their groups aren't out yet! They will face off in a cutthroat mini-league where only the winner grabs a ticket to the Round of 16.
- The Knockouts: No more second chances. Head-to-head duels.
- Round of 16 Quarter-Finals Semi-Finals The Grand Final.
